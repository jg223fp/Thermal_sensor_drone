## Setting up TTN
Here is a short explenation of how to set up The Things Network(TTN) when sending your data by LoRa.
First of you will need an acount on www.thethingsnetwork.org so create one if you havenÂ´t.
The second thing you want to do is to create an application. The application is our own small program that will receive the packages that we send.
