## Abstract
?

## Background
The vast property of a disposal processing plant or a recycling facility can be hard to monitor. A fire can be devastating so if heat generation can be detected in an early stage, the risk of injuries and damage on environment can be minimized.

## Idea
Develop an airbourne product that periodically measures surface temperature to detect anomalis and report them via wireless network for further processing.
