## Abstract
The project aimed to develop a simple, yet effective, IoT-device that could help monitor heat generation in wide areas (e.g a disposal processing plant) and notify personel and/or ultimately the fire brigade.

## Background
The idea came from a relative who works as an engineer at a municipality energy department.

He described how the vast property of a disposal processing plant or a recycling facility can be hard to monitor. A fire can be devastating so if heat generation can be detected in an early stage, the risk of injuries and damage on environment can be minimized.

## Idea
Develop an airbourne product that periodically measures surface temperature to detect anomalis and report them via wireless network for further processing.
